Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed media slang banging in your boom box
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility, you're killing me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
Rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You want to be an MC, you've got to study the skill
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally you don't have the hip-hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories (bullshit)
And sounding like the only hip-hop you've heard is Top 40 (Top 40)
And your record company is completely missing it
And all the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle you can't hack it, react with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal back flips
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MCs to establish this
You're new to hip-hop and welcome if you're serious
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced
Using the waves of sound the true master
Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack

Come on
Can you fill me in (Let's talk about it)
I was checking this girl next door
When her parents went out
She phoned said, ""hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down start kissing, caressing
Told me about jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean me and her parents were kind of cool
But they ran a fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to
Saying why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
When I returned, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the 4
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to
Saying why can't you keep your promises no more
Say you'll be home by 12, come strolling in at 4
Out went the girls but leaving with the boy next door
Can you fill me in
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV
Can you fill me in
All they seem to do is be checking up on you baby
Watchin' our every move, think some day they might approve baby
Why were you creeping around late last night
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light
Now you're dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white

Something's rotten, things got [complete] outta hand
Too far gone, someone's gonna understand
She controls my mind, makes me do things I don't want to
She's the dangerous kind, there was nothing I could do
I'm standing all this playing games, but this time she pushed me too far
Oh-oh, the damage is done

Far too late, I found out what you were up to
As if hypnotized, I played criminal to please you
And totally paralyzed, now there's nothing I can do
I don't wanna live like this, but now it seems there ain't no way back

As I do so well (Hands up)
Wasn't nothin' like that (Hands up)
Man, it wasn't nothin' like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh at mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it
I was a youngin' straight crushin' tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school
'Cause when I seen 'em thighs on her
And them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming, man what
I'm thinkin' how she ride on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
It make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by, attractions getting deeper
Wet dreaming thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said ""have you ever had sex before""
Damn (sing)
And I ain't never did this before no (go)
And I ain't never did this before no (hey)
And I ain't never did this before no (say what)
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I wrote back and said ""of course I had sex before""
Knowing I was frontin'
I said I was like a pro baby
Knowing I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth I knew I'd get played out son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one
But, she don't know what
So she done roll back and told me
""Oh you a pro homie? Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin'""
That's when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin'
Baby you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when playing on the bed
Teacher please don't make me stand up
I wrote back like ""Yeah baby sound like a plan""
Still trying to play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga, my stomach turned
Talking damn shit knowing damn well I was a virgin

And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
And I ain't never did this before no
You know that feelin' when you you finna bone for the first time
I'm hoping that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all I'm praying God don't let me bust quick
I'm watching pornos tryin' see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on, how it go right
I'm in a crib now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me, ooh girl don't stop
It's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah just how I practice
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro, but baby be gentle""

With a shorty on my lap
With a shorty on the way coming shortly to protect
I could've been a dealer in the party with the X
But I'm hardly in the mix and I partially confess
I definitely got a couple parts in me that I regret
Is the cup half-empty or is it half-full?
I fill mine up with Hennessy, then get back to him
I'm just a jazz musician trapped in a rap form
You think you standing for something you on a trap door
Well it's the, Mr. spective
I'm a dreamers dream, a sort of an inception
I never fiend for the scene but I dreamed of the things
That a Mercedes brings, like slow sex with fast women
Drinking cognac I'm past grinning
A sexy dress, fat ass in it
But still hit it till I'm half-winded
Cause niggas tell me I'm the shit
Well I be hitting all these dimes

Hope you feed us soon, bite your back, you die of rabies
Everyday we pray to eat at the table at Sizzlers
But never make the visit,
If better days was on its way
Then they make the decision, to make the wrong turn
So for now we heat this skillet so this canned food can burn

Of a scholar but shit not today, them Dayton Spokes was his to take
Refrigerators, barbecue pits, and Jordan kicks
They did invasions while helicopters recorded it

Murder was the melody you should know what the is
""Papa you really telling me we can just get some more of it

Continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga""
Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it Another Nigga but, it ain't really a poem,
I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to.
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you,
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--,
About a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground.
What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That's how I see it, my word is bond.
I see--and the ground is the symbol for the poor people,
The poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the
Rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat,
They gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy,
Appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry,
You know what I'm saying it's gonna be like... there might
Be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich
Aight so let me ask you this then,
Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or
Somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural born hustler,
A true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin',
I took the opportunities,
I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so
I could get it to where I owned it.
I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that
Works my management company.
I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years
You know what I'm saying I made myself a millionaire.
I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions
For myself, you know what I'm saying.
I made millions for the record companies,
I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us
And through your different avenues of success,
How would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
And by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true.
"" You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason,
You know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit,
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening.
So it's no problem,
You know I mean it's a problem but I'm not
Finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or
Somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been
Threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance.
And not only me but it goes down my family tree.
You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back
Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like,
We fighting a war,
I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down
In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit
Maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager,
While you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights,
While you still wanna shoot back.
Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of
A man, out of a black man in this country.
And you don't wanna fight no more.
And if you don't believe me you can look around,
You don't see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas
That's crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy
You left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil
Goin' on so I wanted to ask you what you
Think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next
Time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real.
I don't think America know that.
I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some
More playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder,
You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831,
Up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen
That's crazy man. In my opinion,
Only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations,
Lotta people don't understand how important it is.
Sometimes I be like,
Get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy
I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes
Because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin',
We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you.
It's actually something a good friend
Had wrote describing my world. It says:
""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything
Around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the
Caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the
World shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent,
The thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the
Butterfly as weak and figures out
A way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar
Goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots,
Such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that
The caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are
Completely different, they are one and the same.""
What's your perspective on that?

Yo
Alright, let me just kill this right now quickly
Super trippy riding through the gritty inner city
Roll with the committee
Handle your business or handle the pity
All I see is lots of titties
I know bunch of hippie chicks
That's ready to show me tricks
They doing the splits
I'm all up in the mix
A choir out the mist
I'm taking trips
I'm in the Ferrari looking sick
I'm in the Ferrari looking slick
Letting the engine rip
And getting a tire
A' grippin' ah slippin' and slidin'
Turning the music up
I'm vibing now I'm flying
Lord strike me if I'm lying
I ain't perfect but I'm trying
Going super saying and buying
Anything that catches my eye
'Cause I'm a provider getting it in from here to China
It's so minor, I'm a survivor, never retire
I'm a black tiger ready to blaze to the fire, live wire
Now I'm rolling through the shires
Blazing the green to get me higher
Now I'm inspired
Putting the pressure on the back tire
Making a hasty getaway
Having a better day in every way than yesterday
I guess there's nothing left to say
Getting it in from here to China (getting it in from here to China)
Getting it in from here to China (from, from here to China)

Wind in my face
Chilling in Versace shades
Wearing a fresh pair of gaze
Looking like car just been paid
Stupid I don't play no games
Switching out lanes on these lames
Switching out dames simple and plain
No I can't be contained
Plus I'm raw and untamed
I'm so far from mundane
Getting ghost is my aim
I suggest you do the same
Taking a trip out to Spain
With my girl Mary Jane
And she stays on my brain
Like a big gravy train
Papparazi on my case
Giving chase
Cameras flashing in my face
All up in my space
Gotta pick up the pace
Singing Amazing Grace
I'm in an amazing place
With crazy pape's
I ain't like them other lazy apes
I used to blaze the tapes
So now I stays hoping for my break
Making no mistakes
Now I rolling with the breaks
But still book time for my original mates
So we don't bubble with hate
We just get on with it
You brothers are constipated
And your shit is overrated
You should save it

Everyone's a critic, watching, criticizing character
Everybody watching ya, people love to stare at ya
Everybody's greedy ain't nobody tryna' share wit' you
Our leaders are embarrassing, I think they need some parenting
Tell me why the playing with the fire and the carosine
Kids on the percocet, trippin' on the medicine
Call it like I see it we some drugged up Americans
Everybody's following, ain't nobody leading
People lovin' guns, more than kids, it's the season
And they say the reason is to protect their freedom
But we don't believe 'em
'Cause all that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
And all that we have, all that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love
When I was a young boy
Used to hear the people say
Power to the people but we them people nowadays
We ain't never giving up, now we got our hands up
We can't beat, cause their hearts ain't big enough
All we need is just us, hate got ya guessing
War is the answer but really, what's the question
Everybody stressin'
Fear got us flexin'
Phones got us zoned out
Now we lose connection
Please stand by, it takes you and I to keep the whole alive
'Cos we're living in a time where we're fighting to survive
And all we need is love
All that we are
All that we're made of
Is big, big love

All that we have, all that we're made of
Is big, big love
Big, big love
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
That's all that we are
Is big, big love
Is big, big love
Life is a blessing, knowledge is a weapon
You should choose love instead of being reckless
Candle in the darkness, help change the heartless
Use love to guide you, I'll be there regardless
Situation global, we locked in a rowboat
Swimming up the river, so I can deliver
Message to the masses, no matter your status
Nothing's never over, we believe in second chances
Many people dying, government's are lying
Stand for our rights, and please no more violence
Come with the kindness, together we're united
When we are one
Nothing can divide us

Hey! Mr.Vener!
Ah-huh... Yo... Ola
Billionaire Club muchacho. Assorted flavors. And they zillatos
Inspire young minds. I stack my nachos with the raw determination of a vato
Run across the border with bricks in his poncho
Face like a shot when it's bussin' by glocko
Planted these things. Still I died when the Holy Father hand me my wings
When I was young, yo, the teacher couldn't stand when we dreamed
Givin' me music like drugs and to hand to a fiend
They shoot it up
See me on the TV the cuties - they wanna fuck
Both residential that's plush and cooped it up
Got more hits than a zip. Who want it nuh?
I can go back in time you be Judge Ito. With my mini-torpedo
I know you're thinking ""neat-o!""
It would peace the men. It's something like Antigo
But it's three hundred thousand more with no re-mo
Jacob and Lorraine, I used to deal with Tito
But he clowned me and told me that my money's fritos
Now the Enzo doors go up like a D-Lo...
Ree-on... same song sung by my man Nigo. SLR
When the doors go up it's like a fresh L jar
Nigga we boss
He shall not get hot he too frost. Yessur!
My nigga close your eyes. Just picture yourself just holdin' pies
Implement a plan and you surely rise. This promised by the man that controls the skies
Don't you see I know that shit so ill. Better yet, doggie, just tell me how ya feel
Ha-ha. How you feel dawg?!
We just picture, thinkin', dreamin', scheming, bleedin', readin', all in the late night
Shake it, boilin', lacin', bakin', shapin', shavin', gotta get this cake right
As I serve it, you just burn it, breathe it, learn it, now watch it take flight...
Nigga how does it feel? Ha-ha.Yessur!)
Nigga you don't know me
I'm part Howard Hughes, part horny, part holy
First trick on the ramp is the rockin' rollie
Keep one on my staff with a new pro chromey
It bequeaths me to mention that I've been bitten
But affords me to chuckle at what critics have written
He dresses insane - but his music admire
Ask Anna Wintour from Vogue and Esquire
And Vanity Fair. You like, kid of the year
But you should guess who's in the insanity chair
Now it ain't about what I want
Still thumbin' through my life like it's drugstore porn
It's one thing to say that you did it
It's one thing to lie about your digits
It's one thing to say that you live it
It's another for you fuckers to admit it
But I admit I got all this paper plus the prettiest faces that's offered by nature
I drive a cas'per, 'scuse me, Casper
Wanna meet 'em in my house I got space like NASA
But it don't make me happier, by itself, or sadder
Or like my sister Stace when she lost her pappa
Or Ben dad, getting' a stroke, and nothin' the Trapper John could do
It's ironic but true - a man dies, baby born its fair as Peru
It's a simple clue between us and imposters
We hop in the air and don't care what it costs us
Now I'm with N.E.R.D. with a pit full of moshers
I guess you could say that we fly like saucers
Zappin' at niggas, we're classin' at vigor
The cash and crash whippers, the Thrasher mag gripper
Go 'head and say it ""You a rappin' ass nigga.""
Yessur!

Fuckin' Wendy's up, brainstormin' ways to get our pennies up
Me and Jasper spendin' last bucks on the city bus
Wayne tapes and Vice mags and Portishead drops
Peglegs, Ice Cream shoes, the Mr. Krabs watch
That was heaven for me 'round time 17
Eggin' niggas' houses, fuckin' girls from Pasadena

I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehhhh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm

Sue you, take your dog
Take your house, take your shoes, take your heart

Hit the club, and you go out don't know a sum

You cheated and total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up 'cause you say
That just giving out your number doesn't count

First you turn your back on me then tell me that I stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it

I hope you hear, I hope this reaches you, uh
All the money in the world, I can't find where they sellin' time
Or a button that rewind, I'm just thinkin', sippin' this wine
Let me catch you up
It's been some time, lets me catch you up, yeah, uh, fuck
I don't know where to start
But somethin' told me, ""Write this down and just speak from the heart""
It's been 14 years since I found you all alone in the dark
But losin' you brought us together when it could've torn us apart
Mom still ain't good, she misses you, she thinks 'bout you daily
We got a dog after you passed, and she nicknamed her Missy
She lives alone out in New Orleans, she always tells me she miss me
But such is life, this story's real, it's not a movie by Disney
She'll probably tell you I wrote a song and put your story inside it, fuck
I forgot to tell you, I'm like famous rapper now
Signed a record deal, I made all of my dreams come true
I toured the world, made platinums albums, and I still stayed true
It's so much to catch up on now as I think out loud
When you passed, I was fuckin' up, still I was a problem child
But we had promises to each other, yeah, I swore, and I vowed
I went to college, I graduated, I would've made you proud
I'm 'bout to turn 30, James is 'bout to turn 27
He's findin' himself still, but I know he'll find out in a second
He graduated from the same school that I went to in NOLA
He lives right up the street from mom's, it's crazy as he's gotten older
He's matured beyond his years, he's the best I guy I know
I find the older I get, it's like the less that I know
This world's confusin', sometimes I feel all depressed, filled with gloom
The more and more I understand why you had to hide in that room, fuck
It's been some time since I had someone I could tell this shit
Celebrity life is full of everyone expectin' shit
In 2019, life is crazy, and it's evident, wait
You won't believe this part, but Trump was the president
And Leo finally got his Oscar after all
And the Warriors were finally the best team in basketball
Anyways that's all for now, I'll keep it short and sweet
I'll save the rest until the next time we meet, I miss you, Melissa
I found peace
Hope this moment's brief
Shaded memories
I can hardly speak
I found peace (in our dreams)
I just grit my teeth
Through teary eyes, I see
Smilin' back at me
I found peace, I found peace
Yeah, uh
Been seven months since you left
Some nights it hits me harder than others, that's when I get depressed
I play your shit, but I had to stop readin' old texts
I shed tears, sometimes still, fuck it, I've been a mess
Knowin' myself, I was too proud to ever tell this to you
But since you popped out first, I used to be a lil' jealous of you
I used to hate sometimes, Jameel said, ""That's not healthy of you""
But I was broke and unsuccessful, what you expect me to do?
See us, two white boys rappin', felt like they would always compare us
Except you sell out shows across the world from Oakland to Paris
And I was still at my mom's crib, that means I live with my parents
I couldn't sell shit out in my town, I was slightly embarrassed
Fast-forward some years, I finally caught up a bit
I always wonder 'bout that time, like if you fucked with my shit
And then we finally met in Europe, playin' festival shows
You watch my set sidestage, I'm tryna flex at them shows
Until I went and watched yours, you burnt that shit down
We talked shit and caught up afterwards, you fucked with my sound
We clicked, immediately, time passed in a blink
Talkin' shit, I can't believe that was the first time we linked
What I was goin' through with Ash', you went through with Ariana
And you would check in on me daily, help me deal with that drama
Come to think of it, we talked like every day last summer
You were like a big brother, crazy that you was younger
It's, only a dream until it happens to you
But no one ever told me these things would be happenin' too, fuck
Anyways that's all for now, I'll keep this short and sweet
I'll save the rest until the next time we meet, I miss you, Mac

And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, ""Baby, please don't leave""
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you""
Cause I'm stronger than I was
A beautiful face is all that you have
Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby hold me please
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'Til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you""
Cause I'm stronger than I was
You walked out, I almost died, it was almost a homicide
That you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah
On the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I, felt like my, whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda
It's like you put a, knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the, other side
Of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up, finally showed a sign
Of life in me for the, first time since you left me
And left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda, had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with the chump-ions
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Would've been our anniversary
Two years but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now
So I put 'em in a verse to lay
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me, I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be, I may never trust someone
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble, I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream ""Fuck you""

But when it comes to mase
Fuck r kelly i dont take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it
And im putting you under the pavement
No buddhist priest, catholic, or babtist pastor can save him
Im far from religious
But i got beliefs, so i put
Cannary yellow diamonds
On my jesus peace
I came back from the dead
Without a part of my chest
Layed in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years
While everyone else dropped
Now i understand why NAS
Did a song with his pop
Im ready to die
Without a reasonable doubt
Smoke chronic and hit it
Doggy style before i go out
Until they sign my death certificate
All eyez on me
Im still at it, illmatic
And thats THE DOCUMENTARY
If i die my niggas, fuck it
I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a from faith
No verse from Jay
I guess on westside story
He thought i spit in his face
I told Ed Lover & Moni Love
I was talkin to Ja
With that mayback line
It was payback time
Keep fuckin with me nigga
Ill put you under me
Take your car and trade it in
For eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T
I dodt your eyes
You'd do life in a cementary
I'll do mine with shyne
Come home sit in the thrown
With my legs crossed
And my air force
Middle finger rough
Fuck the world
Cause im fellin like puff
When life after death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems
And i lost my best friend
Im the second dopest nigga
From compton u'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums
Every 7 years (haha)
(You know what speakin of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song westside story)
Ohh Ohh
(You got a line that says
Dont wear throwbacks
Or drive, ride in maybacks,
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Naa, i was talkin about Ja Rule
Yeah, So, Yeah, i got a lot of
Respect for Jay
You know what im saying
I never take shots at legends
Thats just something i dont do
Let me tell you why i do this shit
Im a son of a gun
Cause moms was a hoover crip
First day i got signed
I had to prove i spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes
(Son duck is sick)
Told to Jay and Doc Dre.
I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and cube gone
The q gone
They say truth hurts
Chunk, like quick sand
Dont stop me in traffic
And ask about hitman
I gotta restore the feelin
It crawled from under the rock
After the dog pound
Crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed
Im the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan
After i sell 5 million
If i tell you i aint game
And i dont know Dre.
You gonn do me like x-zibit
And cut half of my face?
I take all the credit
For putting the west
Back on the map
If you aint feelin that
Go sign Gorilla Black!!!

Called love, called love
Oh! This must be the way the nigga 'Pac felt when he made
""Me Against the World,"" ""All Eyez on Me""
Y'all niggaz got me feelin like all eyes on me, me against the world
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I did to this game
Bein that, I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood
Come from the same hood you come from
We share basically the same stories
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I came and did
Since ninety-six, every year
Somethin must be seriously wrong with the world
I know y'all ain't hatin

(Some people hate!) Nah. you know what I think?
(Some people hate!) I think.
(I think they've lost their minds) Think y'all lost your mind
Y'all got me on my shit
Raw rough and rugged, when addressin' the mass public
My attitude is fuck it 'cause motherfuckers love it
Got a, chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas
And fuck bein famous, I came to get the butters
I came from the gutter, my success in this game
Is sort of like ""Pro-jectic Justice,"" a payment for brushes
With police officers, a peace offering
From the Gods for the streets I was tossed in
'Til I'm deceased in a coffin
I'ma be a beast on these beats, releasin early and often

Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summers, c'mon

(Some people hate!) Uh, uhh, uhh

I guess it's just the penalty of leadership
I guess I'm what niggaz wanna be and shit
Or niggaz just bored, wanna be in shit
'Fore they get to rappin, start believin it
Think they Ali and shit
I roll with the punches so I survive
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise surprise

It's like a old negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga
You bastards know me, the one and only
Big homey from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely
You need Jesus in your life. it's either that
Or y'all gon' make me put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga!

Jealousy is a weak emotion, y'all gotta overcome that man

I bring them pies out if niggaz wanna burn the strip
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out, turn your six

Get yourself found, drowned, where the lake at

Man, fuck evaluation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold out already got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Oli got the first edition parked up roadside
The only sign of struggling is coming from those guys
I'm trying to just relate what I can see through my own eyes
And nothing tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others, don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that I hide still
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield

Built this house for us all, pain in my back still

I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearing me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even RIP and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortune on me
I even got the cleaning staff plotting extortion on me
My parents divorce's on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what they reporting on me

This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for

And eek classes with mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens' up in your benz's

Playin inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
'Cause you proved who was your wiz

I took a little when you was up north
Your comisary stay pilin
How you livin large on the island
All them collects have me vex
But when you come home

Holdin this grip cocked the green and the shit

For the next couple of days I brought her all I possess
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS
Twin to drive in the passenger with a T.V. rest
For my top draft picks, I cop the new GS
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team
'Cause I ain't sold 'em a dream, I just showed 'em the cream
Picked 'em up in the afternoons and told 'em some things
You know the regular - you do when you moldin' them teens
Yo, never lay your head where you holdin' them things

Never feared no man, put four in his Beem

You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap
And they can look good by paintin him as bad news
Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views
Exposed to the curb and nobody said a word
So imagine how disturbed I was
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club
Let me explain exactly how this shit was
This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin
But it's cool cause we back friends, it happened and it's over
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein Hova
Maybach with the chaffeur, laid back
Helicopter seat, feet inclined, shit feelin like a sofa
Helicopter meet me, Teterboro take me over

If you stated opinions, then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then 'cause there was no reacting, acting up

Everything is heightened now
It's looking so much brighter now
I was lost and now I'm found
Fell off the merry-go-round
I was in the politics
Obsessed with things I couldn't fix
Kissing bigger with a fist
Addicted to the thrill of it
And with these colors fading
People changing feelings
Faking some kind of love
A different flavor, seek the danger
Feel new life rush into my blood
Illuminated, never shaded
See the future when I look in the sky
When I look in the sky, you give me
You give me

Give me the brightest blue (I see no beauty in retrograde)

Blue, blue, blue
There's no blue in the odyssey
Even in the calmest seas
Now it's all I wanna be
A semi-precious mystery
Yeah, I love me more than you
Doesn't mean I can't be true
Slip into the blue lagoons
I could be your muse
Times are hard, people scarred
We don't know if we're gonna fight
Break a heart, play the card
We just came along for the ride
But in the dark, you're the spark

Until you had enough, then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine, and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer) you so sexy
You used to dress and fix your hair
You'd always smiled through your tears
And in the mirror you would stare
And say a prayer
Like I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart
And then had enough, and you took that ring off

Now after all your tears
After all that pain's all clear, mama
After all them years
We can start all over again, mama
And now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end, mama
We can love again
This is where freedom begins, mama

I heard he spent 500 pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached
Owns every single ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means

And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse

Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says, ""Chune, boy, never light up the room""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym, keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him

Oh, white flower with the power to bring life to me
You're so exotic, my whole body fluttering
Constantly craving for a taste of your sticky-sweet
Always on the brink of a heart attack
You give me life and keep me comin' back
I see the sunrise in your eyes, your eyes
We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies
Even the seasons change
Our love still stays the same

Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, cause right now you're mine
And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The water's rough
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong, and
Your hands are tough but they are where mine belong, and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father
About your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
