We took on diesel back in Mantauk yesterday
And left this morning from the bell in Gardiner's Bay
Like all the locals here I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave I work my fingers to the bone
So I could own my Downeaster Alexa
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep
I got bills to pay and children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there but where, God only knows
They say these waters aren't what they used to be
But I've got people back on land who count on me
So if you see my Downeaster Alexa
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel
Now I drive my Downeaster Alexa
More and more miles from shore every year
Since they told me I can't sell no stripers
And there's no luck in swordfishing here
I was a Bayman like my father was before
Can't make a living as a Bayman anymore
There ain't much future for a man who works the sea
But there ain't no island left for Islanders like me

It's either sadness or euphoria.
So we'll argue and we'll compromise,

For all our mutual experience, our separate conclusions are the same.
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity,
Our reason co-exists with our insanity.

Perhaps we don't fulfill each other's fantasies.

The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm lettin' them know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down, no.
So push the button, let the whole thing blow.
Spinning everything outta control, now everybody go.
Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey
Feel alone, final blow
We, the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings, we come for you
Still alone, fight our blow
Filthy animals beat down low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more the sun shall beat down for you
From the front to the back and the side to side

Watch as the room rocks, mentally moonwalk
Mixed media slang banging in your boom box
Verbal violence, lyrical stylist
In a time when rock hip-hop rhymes are childish
You can't tempt me with rhymes that are empty
Rapping to a beat doesn't make you an MC
With your lack of skill and facility, you're killing me
And a DJ in the group just for credibility
I heard that some of you are getting help with your rhymes
You're not an MC if someone else writes your lines
Rapping over rock doesn't make you a pioneer
'Cause rock and hip-hop have collaborated for years
But now they're getting randomly mixed and matched up
All after a fast buck and all the tracks suck
So how does it stack up? None of it's real
You want to be an MC, you've got to study the skill
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Bring it to you every time like this?
Who can rock a rhyme like this?
Step, step up, step, step up
So you pick up a pen and write yourself a new identity
But mentally you don't have the hip-hop energy
With a tendency to make up stories (bullshit)
And sounding like the only hip-hop you've heard is Top 40 (Top 40)
And your record company is completely missing it
And all the kids are dissing it for not being legitimate
So in a battle you can't hack it, react with whack shit
And get smacked with verbal back flips
Get your ass kicked by fabulous battle catalysts
It's taken decades for MCs to establish this
You're new to hip-hop and welcome if you're serious
But not on the mic leave that to the experienced
Using the waves of sound the true master
Paralyzes his opponents, leaving him vulnerable to attack

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
And watches everything
So, know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like a face inside that's right beneath my skin
Hey, yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isn't real
But in my mind, I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds
Hundred degrees
My soul bleeds, devil must've planted the seed
Now it feels like my back's against the wall
I'm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobody's responding at all
But I don't know who I can trust
They screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the frame
All I'm trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blast-to-beat
But something keeps talking to me
Consciously, responsibly, keeps haunting me from dusk 'til dawn
Everything has something for you
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face
Exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off your skin I'd probably find another person
There's nothing worse than trying to bring yourself on back from the dead
So I advise you: listen to that voice in the back of your head
It's like I'm paranoid looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within

It won't be the same this year since loved ones have passed away
We miss them every day
Let's pray, Merry Christmas
Coming together for something good
We're singing in PJs, but we're helping the neighbourhood
We came back with sausage rolls just like you knew we would
And doesn't my mate look good
Oh yeah, Merry Christmas
I feel my hunger comes
Every time the oven turns on
Filled up with so much love
Every pound for this song goes to helping the people along

It's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady the word 'rape' sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs'll ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman
The pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal
'Cause the cunt wouldn't ever let a doctor near someone
That's getting dough for him
'Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in
She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly

For angels to fly
Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up
A little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude that stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But your a heroine for taking the strain
Of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hand only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your Uncle, damn
She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause in the pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside, for angels to fly
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight

Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The copper's trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, ""Who you working for?""
He's talking to like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why
You need to help bring him or her to court
He's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it
He's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, your on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, ""Where you been bitch? I wanna know""
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
Here's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her 13th birthday
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight

Back then
And you knew I fell for you
But you just broke my heart in two
I was sad, mad, and broken on my bed
Hoping I get rid of all the voices in my head
I was opening a packet of an undeveloped med
When I was met with a prescription of a bullet made of lead
And when I woke up in an hour in a pool of my own sweat
I said, ""I swear to God I'll never even try to sleep again""
So instead I took my pen and started writing evidence
And when I started making sense, I found that I had reached the end
Oh, I'm upset, I have no friends, you wanna bet, you're just pretend?
You're just a pet confined within the lines of writing, you're not shit
I thought I stopped my psychopathic ways, I swear I did
I said I talked to people 'bout the problematic life I lived
They were my neighbors, razor blades and different flavored pills I hid
Therefore, I'm at surely my last straw
I'm so gassed, stuck in the past, I said that
Girl, I hope you understand
I wanted to hold your hand
But I can't, wanted to be your man

And so far I never held you with my arms
So it's hard to be the one you aren't with

Always was a part of me, guess I'm not cut out to be

Was an introvert that had converted feelings into writing
Used to cope with all my problems using notes and lots of rhyming
Used to hope for better days whenever nights would have me crying
I'm not lying when I say that I would rather die than go back
To the times that I would try and be the guy the people know as
Always fighting with the demons hiding far behind my eyelids
On an island full of violence, in my head I had two pilots
Oh, the sun don't shine, the skies turn gray
I feel it coursing through my veins
I said before I'm not okay
But you don't listen anyway
You know I tried, you turned away
Straight out lied right to my face
You fucked my life, ruined my day
But you don't know, so I'll say
Nothing can fill this silence
No one can love like I did (you don't know, so I'll say)
Nobody cares, you lied, it's
Not fair, you still deny it (so I'll say)

But I can't, wanted to be your man

And too bad I know I can't wake up
