"""The Take Over, The Breaks Over""",Thriller - 2006/AOL Music Sessions,3Eljf6kcc09IJPjTvUH2nA,"Yeah, what you critics said would never happen. We dedicate this album to anybody, people said couldn't make it. To the fans that held us down till everybody came around. Welcome. It's here. Last summer we took threes across the board But by fall we were a cover story ""now in stores"" Make us poster boys for your scene But we are not making an acceptance speech I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update So long live the car crash hearts Cry on the couch all the poets come to life Fix me in 45 So long live the car crash hearts Cry on the couch all the poets come to life Fix me in 45 I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am The only thing I haven't done yet is die And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife Crowds are won and lost and won again But our hearts beat for the diehards So long live the car crash hearts Cry on the couch all the poets come to life Fix me in 45 So long live the car crash hearts Cry on the couch all the poets come to life Fix me in 45 Long live the car crash hearts (Long live the car crash hearts) Long live the car crash hearts (Long live the car crash hearts) Long live the car crash hearts Cry on the couch all the poets come to life Fix me in 45 Hehe...

2 days into college,2 days into college,1v4m9GLt7lpFM5iOvwQZrU,"I'm two days into college and I'm three lectures behind There's this guy, let's name him Colin He says he wants to be mine But it doesn't really sit with me quite right 'Cause he doesn't really like the things I like And I keep accidentally locking myself out of my dorm in the middle of the night I wake up kinda wired and I wake up kinda cold And I wake up kinda tired but I'll just sleep in when I'm old See I don't like breaking rules but don't like doing as I'm told So I just float around and keep my head down And hope my life unfolds And everybody's telling me that I'm doing so well I try to trust them, honestly, I find it hard to tell If I need work or I need rest To try my best, to try my best To tell myself, I say out loud ""It's fine, I'll figure it all out"" I tend to forget, I'm still only quite young In a way, this life of mine has only just begun I've got time I've got time I'm two days into college with a busy, busy mind That guy that we named Colin, he's so handsome, he's so kind My friends tell me I'm crazy, say I'll take it way too far 'Cause I told him that it's over 'cause he doesn't play guitar I'm only two days into college and my bedroom is a mess There's just so much that I want to do that I have not done yet There's just so much that I want to say and far too little breath Oh my mind, it runs so far away, it's easy to forget That to everybody else it looks like I'm doing so well I try to see it, honestly, I find it hard to tell If I've done wrong or I've done right I need a good night's sleep tonight They said, ""Go out"", I said, ""Alright"" I think I won't, I maybe might I probably should just take it slow I'll be all good, but God I know The one thing that's important above everything else Is to learn not to put all this heavy pressure on myself I try believe it when I say ""If it's meant to happen, it'll happen anyway"" I'll be fine I've got time I've got time That's where I'm at, to be honest Just two days Two days into college ",168,"[""pop""]",2023-12-08,False,Aimee Carty,https://open.spotify.com/track/1v4m9GLt7lpFM5iOvwQZrU,2 days into college,https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/577341e410b873f153a6fcc225bffd84b8679399?cid=162b7dc01f3a4a2ca32ed3cec83d1e02,https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b273b1d199f12f84981c4572fb1f,hope,3
